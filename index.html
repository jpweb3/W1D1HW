    <h1>Hello Rangers 127 Cohort!</h1>
    <p>
        We are very excited to kick off the next 10 weeks with y'all. But it's very
        important, before we begin, for us to know how funny y'all are. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        Please add below in a p tag your favorite joke. Once complete, push up to Github & send a pull
        request to your cool instructor, Alex. Thanks!
